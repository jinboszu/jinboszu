### 👋 Ni Hao!

I'm Bo Jin, an Assistant Professor at the Department of Management, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

I primarily research on the methodology of Operations Research.

**Trivia:**

- I used to compete in the 💭💡🎈 [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/), formerly known as ACM-ICPC. In the [34th ICPC Asia Harbin Regional Contest](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Harbin-2010/standings), I won a 🏅 Gold Medal with a third-place ranking, which allowed me to advance to the [34th ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.global/community/results-2010).
