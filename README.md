### 👋 Ni Hao!

My name is Bo Jin ([homepage](https://jinboszu.github.io)) and I’m an Assistant Professor at Shenzhen University, China.

I primarily research on the methodology of Operations Research.

If you encounter bugs or have any questions, please file new issues or contact me via email.

*Suggestions and collaborations are welcome!*

**Trivia:**

- I used to competed in the 💭💡🎈 [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/), formerly known as ACM-ICPC. In the [2009 ACM-ICPC Asia Harbin Regional Contest](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Harbin-2009/standings), I was awarded a 🏅 Gold Medal and placed third, which allowed me to advance to the 2010 ICPC World Finals.
- I strongly advocate for the Oxford comma, the author–year citation style, and proper usage of hyphens and dashes.
- I play Dota 2 and have been playing it since 2007, as well as its predecessor, DotA.
